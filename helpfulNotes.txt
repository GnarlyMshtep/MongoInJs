SCHEMA: 
    Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.
        where a collection is a group of documents that is in a database, I belive 
    example: 

    const blogSchema = new Schema({
        title:  String, // String is shorthand for {type: String}
        author: String,
        body:   String,
        comments: [{ body: String, date: Date }],
        date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
        hidden: Boolean,
        meta: {
            votes: Number,
            favs:  Number
        }
  });

MODELS: 
    mongoose.model(modelName, schema): returns a model we can work with, allows us to make documents
    for example: 
        const doc = new Model();
        await doc.save(); as u can see, we need await on save (which was my problem when the new object would not apear...)

INSTANCE METHODS: 
    note: DO NOT use ()=> because no binding, so can't use this

    Example: 
    animalSchema.methods.findSimilarTypes = function(cb) {
        return mongoose.model('Animal').find({ type: this.type }, cb);
    };
